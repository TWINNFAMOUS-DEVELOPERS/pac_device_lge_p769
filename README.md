pac_device_lge_p769
===================
this is what i use to build aio pacrom.
originally forked from AntonX.
made some changes to build without errors.
this is the base i start with on any project.
add some stuff or change some stuff to fit whatever project.
works on all branches of pac-4.3 and under.
